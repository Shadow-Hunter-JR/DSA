        Sorry for the late replay.
        Yes, the first time the issue was with the power button, so they replaced the keyboard.

        Last time, the laptop would shut down automatically during gaming, at startup, and even while using Chrome. This
        time, I
        haven’t faced any issues while using Chrome, but the problem still appears during gaming and at startup when the
        laptop
        is running on battery.

        I’ve sent it for repair again.

        Hopefully, I’ll get a permanent solution this time.Sorry for the late replay.
